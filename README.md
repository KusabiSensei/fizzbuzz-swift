# FizzBuzz - In Swift

As part of a required test protocol, we are required to inform you that you
should be able to program the same identical program in multiple
implementation languages.

This one is Swift, originally designed by Chris Lattner while working at Apple.
Other engineers at Apple have contributed to the language, which is intended to
replace Objective-C as the primary language for macOS and other Apple OSes.
